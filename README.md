<dd>A specification to more rigorously define the terms used in the description of this specification.</dd>
<dt>Client</dt>
<dd>Specifications to be followed by applications to participate in the SuteraVR network and render and interact virtual worlds.</dd>
<dt>Bloom</dt>
<dd>Specifications to be followed by servers that mediate communication between clients and store persistent assets in a distributed way.</dd>
<dt>Costume</dt>
<dd>Specifications to be followed by costumes distributed by the SuteraVR network.</dd>
<dt>World</dt>
<dd>Specifications to be followed by worlds distributed by the SuteraVR network.</dd>

## How to use SuteraVR?
SuteraVR is a kind of collection of specifications, and not specific software/sourcecode.
For example, any application that conforms to the same version `SuteraVR/Specifications/Client` can join the SuteraVR network at any time.
Thus, an application that complies with the SuteraVR specification is called an "implementation" of SuteraVR.

Below is an some of a SuteraVR implementation commonly used by SuteraVR users.
