SuteraVR is a protocol that constitutes a distributed and decentralized VR platform and consists of several specifications:
<dl>
<dt>Glossary</dt>
<dd>A specification to more rigorously define the terms used in the description of this specification.</dd>
<dt>Client</dt>
<dd>Specifications to be followed by applications to participate in the SuteraVR network and render and interact virtual worlds.</dd>
<dt>Bloom</dt>
<dd>Specifications to be followed by servers that mediate communication between clients and store persistent assets in a distributed way.</dd>
<dt>Costume</dt>
<dd>Specifications to be followed by costumes distributed by the SuteraVR network.</dd>
<dt>World</dt>
<dd>Specifications to be followed by worlds distributed by the SuteraVR network.</dd>

## ðŸŽ® How to use SuteraVR?

SuteraVR is a kind of collection of specifications, and not specific software/sourcecode.
For example, any application that conforms to the same version `SuteraVR/Specifications/Client` can join the SuteraVR network at any time.
Thus, an application that complies with the SuteraVR specification is called an "implementation" of SuteraVR.

Below is an some of a SuteraVR implementation commonly used by SuteraVR users.

### The well-known implementations

**SuteraVR/Specifications/Client**
  - SuteraVR/Godot-Client (maintained by SuteraVR Team, **Under developing, not for use**)

**SuteraVR/Specifications/Bloom**
  - SuteraVR/sutera-bloom-rs (maintained by SuteraVR Team, **Under developing, not for use**)

## ðŸ§­ Concept

- **Distributed & Decentralized**
  - To make the metaverse as certain as reality, it must not become fragile things dependent on specific companies or platforms. Virtual Reality, forever.

## âœ¨ Design

- **Bloom**
  - You can create a bloom that works as an independent metaverse platform: play with friends, share worlds and items. All blooms communicate with each other, and be able to access contents of other blooms.
- **Sandbox Enviroment**
  - Complete data processing within the sandbox environment. Prevent viruses and malicious scripts from executing and influencing the outside world.
- **SuteraVR SDK**
  - You can upload avatars/worlds/items, and attach functions whatever you coded.



## ðŸŒ¼ Name Origin

Are you worrying that "Sutera" is a misspelling of "Stella"?
The name comes from the Sutera flower of the Scrophulariaceae family, known as Bacopa.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

- ActivityPub Softwares: Misskey, Mastodon, etc
- Metaverse Platforms: VRChat, Resonite, etc
